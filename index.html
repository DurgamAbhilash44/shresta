            <h1>Raw Cotton Bales</h1>
            <p>Our procurement process begins with the careful selection of raw cotton, followed by a meticulous cleaning process. The cleaned cotton undergoes advanced ginning procedures using state-of-the-art machinery, meticulously separating the valuable lint from the seeds. The resulting lint is then skillfully compressed into high-quality bales, each weighing 170 kgs.

                We recognize that proper packaging is paramount to maintaining the pristine quality of our product from production to delivery. To this end, we employ top-quality materials for tightly wrapping our bales, ensuring a seamless and secure transportation process.
                
                At Kaveri Group, we offer a diverse range of cotton varieties, including:
                
                MCU-5
                Shankar â€“ 6
                DCH -32
                J-34
                Bunny Brahma
                Our commitment to the cotton industry goes beyond business; we actively engage with and support farmers at the grassroots level. As advocates for sustainable farming practices, we are proud members of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) and willingly pay premiums for Better Cotton, demonstrating our dedication to fostering a sustainable and responsible cotton industry.</p>

                    CONTAMINATION
                </div>
                Contamination, a major problem for Indian cotton, is the main reason for lower Indian cotton prices when compared to that of cotton from the rest of the world given the same quality parameters. At Shresta, we continuously try to reduce contamination levels throughout all stages of our production.

                    Soon, Shresta Group plans to install Vetal scanner to reduce cotton contamination and provide the least contaminated cotton to our customers.
                    
                    How we are trying to handle this issue at our group:
